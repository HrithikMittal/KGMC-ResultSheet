# KGMC-ResultSheet

### This website will give the mark sheet of student on the basis of the Roll Number but not providing the result sheet based on rank. So Using this script would help to create the excel file which will contain marks of every student. 
### I used Python package Selenium with chromedriver then using the driver I scrapped the data and saved to the excel file.
